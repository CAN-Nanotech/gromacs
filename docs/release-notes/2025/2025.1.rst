with an assertion failure.

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The force calculation was not correctly updated when doing the transformation.

Improve handling of muParser

When building with ``DGMX_USE_MUPARSER`` set to ``EXTERNAL`` or ``NONE``,

Fix build issues with MSVC and CUDA
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Silence a few harmless warnings when building with a recent compiler for ARM SVE.

Fix CMake issues when building with Plumed
