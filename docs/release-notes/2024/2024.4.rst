GROMACS 2024.4 release notes
----------------------------

This version was released on TODO, 2024. These release notes
document the changes that have taken place in |Gromacs| since the
previous 2024.3 version, to fix known issues. It also incorporates all
fixes made in version 2023.6 and earlier, which you can find described
in the :ref:`release-notes`.

.. Note to developers!
   Please use """"""" to underline the individual entries for fixed issues in the subfolders,
   otherwise the formatting on the webpage is messed up.
   Also, please use the syntax :issue:`number` to reference issues on GitLab, without
   a space between the colon and number!

Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Fix missing non-bonded interactions close to cut-off with GPUs
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The GPU rolling pruning employed with the dual pair list setup used
an incorrect list part calculation. This caused a few parlist entries
not to be updated after the initial pruning, leading to a small number
of missing pair interactions. Unless the pair list lifetime ``nstlist``
was very large, these interactions were close to the cut-off and therefore
the errors were small.

Affected simulations: all GPU accelerated runs using GROMACS versions
starting with the 2018 release with dual pair list enabled.
This is enabled automatically with default Verlet buffering, but
it is disabled if the Verlet buffer is manually set
(or if the ``GMX_DISABLE_DYNAMICPRUNING`` environment variable is set).

Impact: Our analysis shows that the error caused by the missing interactions
does not have a measurable effect on either forces or energy conservation
in most atomistic simulations with default simulation settings.
While a manually increased ``nstlist``, hence increased (outer) pair list lifetime,
leads to an increase in the number of missing interactions, for useful value of
``nstlist`` the effect is still negligible.
There can be measurable effects in systems with vacuum, gas, or with
excessively large ``nstlist`` values. In our testing we could not detect artifacts
apart from systems crashing, so the chance of undetected incorrect results is small.

:issue:`5138`

Fix illegal memory access with more VCM than T-coupling groups
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When there were more center of mass motion removal groups than
temperature coupling groups, mdrun could crash due to illegal
memory access. This bug did not affect the simulation results.

:issue:`5167`

Fix Colvars output files always written to the working directory.
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Colvars output files are now written in the same folder as edr file.

:issue:`5122`

Forbid the usage of triangle constraints with -update gpu
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Prevent using update on GPU if there are triangle constraints.

:issue:`5123`

``gmx_mpi mdrun`` could hang when using GPUs and separate PME ranks 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A logic error in task assignment for ``-nb gpu -pme cpu`` and separate PME ranks
made the (default) ``-ddorder interleave`` hang. Now it works.

:issue:`4345`

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix dump crash with Colvars values
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Fix `gmx dump` crash when trying to output the binary Colvars state file.


:issue:`5034`

Fixes that affect portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix physical validation with Pymbar version 4
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Pymbar version 4 has a different API compared to version 3. Now we support
using either of those versions and internally handle the API differences.

:issue:`5130`

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Work around FetchContent warnings in CMake 3.30 and newer
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

CMake 3.30 began to complain about |Gromacs| use of FetchContent, so
now we tell such new versions to use the old policy.

:issue:`5140`

Fix various crashes when GMX_USE_COLVARS=NONE
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Colvars MDModule did not defined the Colvars custom mdp variables
when the Colvars library was not compiled, preventing tools
read correctly a tpr file generated with a GROMACS-Colvars version.
Prevent also the creation of a tpr file if Colvars module is activated
whereas GROMACS was not compiled with Colvars.
Proper exit if a Colvars simulation is launched whereas GROMACS was not
compiled with Colvars.

:issue:`5055`

Fix reading cgroups in some kubernetes containers
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Modern versions of kubernetes/docker do not appear to mount /etc/mtab in
the containers, and if we did not find cgroups we would not detect CPU
limits set through cgroups. Fixed by reading /proc/mounts instead.
This will only influence performance when running in (some) containers.
